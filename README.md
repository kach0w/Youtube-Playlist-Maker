# Google Extension
<b>Working with Google Extensions</b>

Found a good framework to build my own extension (@T-L-H)

Here is what mine does: 

Creates a list of a youtuber's video with the urls for each accessible in the extension popup

# Download:

I have to pay $5 to become a chrome web store developer and upload the extension.

So instead, download it 
<a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kach0w/Youtube-Playlist-Maker/master/downloads/Youtube-Playlist-Maker.zip">here</a>. Then go to the <a href="https://chrome://extensions/">chrome extension dashboard</a> and press load unpacked to upload the zip file.
<!--<a download="extension.zip" href="/downloads/Youtube-Playlist-Maker.zip" title="extension">here</a>:-->

# Usage:

One properly downloaded, go to Youtube and go to a Youtuber's page. Once there press "Add Links" and the links of all the youtube videos on that page will be shown. Copy the file into a text document and your playlist is finished.

# Plans:

Make list available in downloadable file

Publish to web store?

Copy list button (if necessary)
